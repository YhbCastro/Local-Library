# Local-Library

Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Others are taking care of the logistics and and design, but they need you to build the algorithms!

This project is designed to test your ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets. Before taking on this module, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below. You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

# Instructions

You are tasked with building a number of different algorithms that will help complete the an administrative site for a local library. All of the functions will work on three common datasets. The datasets are related and at times you will need to work with multiple datasets to solve the problem at hand.

While working on these problems, you have both the tests and the live site to act as a guide. You can solve the tasks in any order and are encouraged to organize your code how you like.

All of the files you need to edit are inside of the public/src/ directory.

While working on this project you should:

 - Use well-named variables, in particular avoiding any single letter variables that lack meaning.
  
 - Use native array methods like .find(), .filter(), .map(), and .reduce().
  
 - Make use of both function declarations and arrow functions.
  
 - Build helper functions when appropriate.
  
 - Make use of advanced JavaScript features like ternary operators, the spread operator, object shorthand, array and object destructuring, and for/in loops.
  
While working on this project you should not:
 
 - Change the names of the functions.
  
 - Edit any of the files outside of the public/src/ directory.
  
 - If you feel as though one of your solutions is working but something isn't showing up right on the site or in the tests, reach out for help.
